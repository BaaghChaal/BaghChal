# OVERVIEW

“बाघ-चाल” (Baghchal) is a game originated in Nepal. A game
so unique on itself that it even didn’t require a paper or wooden board to play. A grid
inscribed on the floor with a small piece of brick, 20 small paper balls, and 4 slightly
bigger paper balls is what makes this game simply oriented but complex skill required
game. Surely this game has glorified the childhood of many people in Nepal. So, our
team take the initiative to make this wonderful game in digital format.
<br><br>
Baag-Chal games has 24 pieces; 20 goat pieces and 4 tiger pieces. On a 5* 5-point grid,
pieces are positioned at the intersection of the lines and not inside the areas as in
‘Chess’. The pieces must move within the connected lines to be qualified as a valid
move. The game is played in two phases where in first phase, the goat pieces must be
placed on the board while the tiger pieces can move. Once all the goat prices are placed
on the board, there and then the goat pieces can be moved which is the second phase.
For the tiger players to win the game, they need hunt down five goat pieces. It’s simple,
jump over the goat piece to a blank spot to hunt it. For the goat players,
cornering/capturing all 4 tigers is going to win them the game.

#  MOTIVATION

There have been many such games developed in the past era, but nothing has surpassed
the global success of Chess. Originated from India as ‘Shah Mat', it has been a global
outreach like no other game. Wondering about this with the team, we started
researching the cultural board games of Nepal. We had a few options to choose from
to make a computer game for the project. We chose 'Bagh-Chal" game for the project
because investigating the game, we came across a few sites that were providing the
game in the digital format, but the overall experience was not engaging. By playing our
version, you receive an authentic experience of joy and remorse while socializing with
your friends/families.
